# Mixing console backend
Backend for a sound mixing console web application

To run scala projects in IntelliJ, you need to install the [Scala plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/enabling-and-disabling-plugins.html)  
  Click on install JetBrains plugins and search for Scala  

Setup steps:
* Download [sbt 1.0.2](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)  (Should be bundled with IntelliJ)
* Download a JDK and a JRE if you don't have one (Most likely comes with your IDE)
* Set JAVA_HOME environment variable to your JDK folder (Only if sbt gives you trouble)


This project uses [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/) and [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/Home) to expose a REST api.
